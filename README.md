# strapi-prompt

Please set up a new Vite project using the chakra-ui template. The app will be for managing prompts and have user registration/login functionality.

In the App.tsx file, set up a basic responsive layout with:
- A header with the app name 
- A main content area
- A footer with a copyright notice

No need to implement any actual functionality yet, just the basic app structure and layout.
